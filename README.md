Simple Rails application to short big urls and to generate impressions.

Demo application is application available on http://short-url-application.herokuapp.com/

Api List is available at 
http://short-url-application.herokuapp.com/shortened/<short_url>.json

For example, http://short-url-application.herokuapp.com/shortened/gPNIyO.json

What Next: Currently for the impressions, you have to pass table id in the url, so I am working on that, to fix this issue.
